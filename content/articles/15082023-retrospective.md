`It is difficult to start something, just like doing retrospective personally on this post.`

It's about time to reflect myself and keep the record, sometimes you just do something you think that's right. So let's start the first one.

## Work (Job-wise)

It is a month to start my new job in a rather big company compared to my previous experiences. Here are some thought and differences.

 - Onboarding process; I haven't thought of a month of onboarding period before, I just started some tasks after a two to three days to setup the computer and read a bit about the codebase or service used. Interestingly the company onboarding guide is a bit "rusty" and in a rewriting process, I guess this is a common scenario for big company even in tech industryüòÖ. Such "maintenance" task especially for developer without directly affecting the current workflow will be outdated someday. Sounds avoidable process, bit pathetic. But somehow it makes the newcomer to ask colleagues questions, this seems a good way to encourage communication, especially in Hong Kong(?), whereas engineers do not talk much. (And Hongkongers in general not so good at "chit chat" to know each otherüòê)
 - Codebase; Of course the size is much bigger, and some of them will be messy. This is actually common and easy to think about, every engineer is difference! So it is impossible to have same code quality. I would say the bottom line is you can read to know the workflow, even though it might be silly on first sight. I always think the importance of code is readability, others make the code more beautiful or effective. Just like writing a simple blog (Like this! Mediocre English writingüòÖ) requires basic understanding but writing a poem needs beauty. Also make sure the code is readable is not only for the coworker but yourself since future you needs communicate with past/current you.

For the onboarding process, I even try to setup VM to test startup script, though it seems more "experiment" rather then something will be done in a long run. Perhaps it is good prepartion for a new machine in case.

## Work (Community)

Due to company policy I switch to use Alt-Tab rather then still beta version's HyperSwitch for window switcher behaviour. It currently lacks of Vim-style window selection shortcut provided in HyperSwitch, I intend to take the task over, however I discover the need of refactoring. At the time of my retrospective I am still working on that. Hopefully I could done that. (In case someone curious: https://github.com/lwouis/alt-tab-macos/pull/1272)

## Personal

I wanna start quite a number of things and started! Here are the items:

- Retrospective; I intend to do that monthly
- Task management; I found out [Sorted](https://www.sortedapp.com/) UX is intriguing enough for me to keep using it on iPhone
- Budget management; Lost the habit years ago and I found out my friend doing that, so I try it out again

Hopefully I can keep those items, start something until it becomes your habit.

## Reflection

Refactoring is important, I have seen my senior to do that on previous company, but I am now facing that in different scenarios. In company works, even I am now just doing small tasks, the behaviours are coupled in the same single function. Yes it works, but then the modification will be a trouble. In Alt-Tab case, it makes the feature updates a hurdle, also introducing UX bug on that due to the flow is not consistent.

And I realize the need of a professional engineer, not only requires the hard skill in knowledge or engineering but the soft skill, communication could be more important. It is about how to pass the message in a accurate and effective way. In fact I recognized design pattern is also about communication, good design tells "just enough" related information on that part, rather then having different items which only couple not necessary information in between.

As there are more tasks on person the importance of planning is surging, also a random walk on bookstore pops [How Big Things Get Done](https://www.amazon.com/How-Big-Things-Get-Done/dp/0593239512) up, guess another reading debt is coming.

## Remarks

- More planning for next retrospective; Use Sorted to draft more point
- About 90 mins for the post; Not bad I think!
