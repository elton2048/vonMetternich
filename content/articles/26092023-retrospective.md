`Persistance is the power.`

Monthly retrospective is my target in previous post, so I am keeping it. It takes time to get a habit and achieve something.

## Work (Job-wise)

### Remote work

I am now more familiar with the environment and workflow, but still not quite get used to wholly virtual connection, especially in engineering team. I haven't seen all of my colleagues face-to-face! In fact it couldn't be happened even in a year of time.

This echos a view which remote working could be the paradigm shift for white-collar workers. Although I don't take a optimistic view of that from day one, I always see people have the best communication in face-to-face scenario. The voice, tone, facial expression and body language are all contain hidden messages in communication. Also onsite work can provide chances to have chit-chat which enhances further professional communication later and sparks ideas occasionally. All these are missing in totally remote work environment, in exchange people have a more free schedule, more time to stay with those already beloved one, or me time. People can't have the cake and eat it, after all balance is the most difficult thing. For someone who has just started the career, chance to know more people is precious, and working environment is the best entry for this. For those who already have a network and a family to take care, remote work of course suits better.

For me, hybrid is a solutionüòâ, although I can't control my colleagues come back and get to know each otherüòÖ...

## Code review

This is a big point from my direct manager, as a senior doing more code review is important. One basic point is to keep check the code quality, and also share some good practice for the team, which is good for both team and reviewr. For the team, it perhaps brings some new ideas from a rather external point of view; For the reviewer, he gets to know the rules and convention in the team, also get some new practice which is not known before.

Personally I enjoyed such work, especially when I feel more comfortable to express (Yes I am not such expressive person, but I am tackling the hurdle, just like this blogging practice!), understand the comment is good for the team, no enforcement most of the time (This should probably be done in design phase), and mistakes just happened. Then it starts to be on the right track.

I remembered once a junior asked me some hint on being a senior, I can't answer that at the moment but now I have a good point, and this is not only for being a senior but a good software engineer. **To read more code**, and do code review "voluntarily". This is the fundamental way to understand how things work for software (and sometimes hardware too), and more importantly, how people construct it to work. Think about the algorithmic course, you can probably understand the logic behind by reading the text, by reading the (pseudo)code alone, then you know how things work. But how can a function be applied in a real life scenario? It is better to find some real example in Github or elsewhere, and see how the code is constructed, what is the naming convention, how comments is made to help the code. These are all software engineers need to consider apart from the logic behind the code, and these could probably be more important from time to time, because they are actually how the communication works in engineers' mind. After all software engineering is a form of communication to give instruction how machine works, and the instruction have to be understood by human too.

## Work (Community)

The investigation of refactoring for the Vim-style window selection shortcut is almost finished, but I haven't that time to get all the parts doneü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, hope this could be done in the following month.

## Personal

There are some ideas on improving the blog

- Embed [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/); Online IDE; I used that to test Javascript/Typescript/React code scenario, also a good place to have test case like [flowbite-svelte](https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite-svelte)
- An article about Javascipt variable declaration using promise reject, there are some discussion about this with colleagues. It seems a good case study for such syntax in Javascript, and perhaps compared to Swift, which I first knowing this pattern like the following
```swift
guard let someVariable = throwableVariable else { return }
```

## Bookmarks

I think I need a good way to "sync" this up... Left in different machines and like a mess which I don't wish to organize this all the time for now...

# Remarks

- Need to keep Emacs config updated as I used different machinesüòÖ
- Another 90 mins used in different time slot; Feeling more comfortable
- New terminal `starship` is used in working machine, consider keeping this config?
